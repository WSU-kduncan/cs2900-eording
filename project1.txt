Host OS I chose: Linux - Ubuntu 64bit 

Disk Space Reservered: 2G. I am not allowing to expand because I do not want it to take over my actual OS and slow down my system. 

I am going to be creating a virtual disk so I have a hard copy of it in my files

Not allowing 3D alleration 

Guest Additions should be included! It makes it easier! 

I went and downloaded the VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO, went to my storage

 of my whole machine and added it as a dik. 

 From there, I went on my actual VM and under devices, I selected "insert cd/disk". It then prompted me to run and install Guest Additions. 

 The ISO package was then installed

 Then, I went to my VM's view settings and enabled full screen mode.
