Host OS I chose: Linux - Ubuntu 64bit 

Disk Space Reservered: 2G. I am not allowing to expand because I do not want it to take over my actual OS and slow down my system. 

I am going to be creating a virtual disk so I have a hard copy of it in my files

Not allowing 3D alleration 

Guest Additions should be included! It makes it easier! 

I went and downloaded the VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO, went to my storage of my VM and added the ISO underneath controller IDE. From there, I went on my acutla VM and went to the file location of that ISO and clicked "Run Software." The ISO package was then installed. Then, I went to my machines settings and on the first tab, I clicked advance and then changed Clipboard and Drag n' Drop to bidirectional.
